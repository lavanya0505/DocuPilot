 *
 * WHY "use client"?
 * -----------------
 * Next.js renders components on the SERVER by default, which is faster and
 * better for search engines. But server components cannot use browser-only
 * features -- no hooks, no event handlers, no animation.
 *
 * This page uses Framer Motion and reads localStorage, so it must run in the
 * browser. `"use client"` at the very top of the file is how you say so.
