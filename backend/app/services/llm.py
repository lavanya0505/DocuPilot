WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
This is the "G" in RAG -- GENERATION.

By the time we get here, `retrieval.py` has already found the handful of
document paragraphs most likely to contain the answer. This file's job is to
hand those paragraphs plus the user's question to a Large Language Model and
get back a written, human-readable answer.

THE ENTIRE IDEA OF RAG IN FOUR LINES
------------------------------------
    1. RETRIEVE : find the paragraphs relevant to the question   (retrieval.py)
    2. AUGMENT  : paste those paragraphs into the prompt         (this file)
    3. GENERATE : the LLM writes an answer using only that text  (this file)
    4. CITE     : we report which paragraphs were used           (chat.py)

Why bother? An LLM on its own has never seen your company's documents, so if
you ask about your internal leave policy it will confidently invent one -- this
is called hallucination. By pasting the real text into the prompt and
instructing the model to use nothing else, the answer becomes grounded in your
actual documents, and every claim can be traced back to a page number.

WHICH MODEL AND WHY
-------------------
We use Groq, which serves open models such as Llama 3.3 70B.
  * Free tier, no credit card required -> perfect for a portfolio project.
  * Extremely fast (hundreds of tokens per second), so the chat UI feels alive.
  * Its SDK mirrors OpenAI's, so switching providers later is a small change.

# THE SYSTEM PROMPT
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# A "system prompt" sets the model's standing instructions before it ever sees
# the user's question. It is the single most important piece of text in a RAG
# application, because it is what forces the model to stay honest.
#
# Every rule below exists to prevent one specific failure mode:
#   Rule 1-2 : stop the model answering from its own training data
#   Rule 3   : make it admit ignorance rather than invent an answer
#   Rule 4   : make each claim traceable to a source
#   Rule 5   : keep answers readable
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a precise enterprise document analyst.

You will be given NUMBERED EXCERPTS from a company's internal documents,
followed by a QUESTION from an employee.

Follow these rules strictly:

1. Answer using ONLY information found in the excerpts provided. Do not use
   outside knowledge, and do not guess.
2. If the excerpts do not contain enough information to answer, reply exactly:
   "I could not find that information in the uploaded documents."
   Do not attempt a partial or speculative answer.
3. Never invent facts, figures, dates, names, or policies.
4. Cite the excerpt you used for each claim with its bracketed number, like
   [1] or [2]. Place the citation immediately after the sentence it supports.
5. Be concise and direct. Use short paragraphs or bullet points. Do not repeat
   the question back to the user, and do not add a preamble.
