retrieval.py
============
WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
This is the "R" in RAG -- RETRIEVAL. It answers one question:

    "Out of every paragraph of every document in this project, which handful
     are most likely to contain the answer to what the user just asked?"

This file was the missing half of the system. Before it existed, documents
were being read, chunked and embedded into the database perfectly -- and then
nothing ever read those vectors back out. This is the piece that makes the
stored embeddings actually useful.

HOW SEMANTIC SEARCH ACTUALLY WORKS
----------------------------------
Ordinary search matches LETTERS. Searching "leave policy" finds only documents
containing those exact words, and misses a paragraph headed "Annual Holiday
Entitlement" entirely.

Semantic search matches MEANING:

    1. The user's question is converted into a vector -- a list of 384 numbers
       describing its meaning.  (embedding.py does this)
    2. Every chunk already has such a vector, computed when the document was
       uploaded.  (ingestion.py did this)
    3. We ask Postgres to sort every chunk by how CLOSE its vector is to the
       question's vector, and return the closest few.

"Close" is measured with COSINE DISTANCE, which compares the direction two
vectors point in rather than their length:

        distance 0.0  -> identical direction  -> same meaning
        distance 1.0  -> perpendicular        -> unrelated
        distance 2.0  -> opposite direction   -> opposite meaning

We convert that into an easier-to-read SIMILARITY score:

        similarity = 1 - distance      (1.0 = perfect match, 0 = unrelated)

WHY THE DATABASE DOES THE MATH
------------------------------
We could load all the vectors into Python and compare them there, but that
would mean pulling potentially millions of rows over the network on every
search. Instead, the `pgvector` extension teaches Postgres to understand
vectors natively, so the comparison and the sorting happen inside the database
and only the top few rows travel back. This is the single most important
performance decision in the whole retrieval path.

SECURITY -- THE PART THAT MATTERS MOST
--------------------------------------
This application is MULTI-TENANT: many organizations share one database. A
search MUST never return a chunk belonging to another organization. Every
query in this file therefore joins all the way up the ownership chain

        ChunkEmbedding -> Chunk -> Document -> Project -> Organization

and filters on the caller's own `org_id`. That check is not optional and is not
done in the frontend -- it is enforced here, in the query itself, so there is
no code path that can accidentally skip it.

        Find the chunks whose meaning is closest to `query`.

        Arguments:
            db          -- the open database session.
            query       -- the user's question, in plain English.
            org_id      -- the caller's organization. THE SECURITY BOUNDARY.

            top_k       -- how many results to return (defaults from settings).
            min_score   -- discard anything less similar than this.

        Returns a list of dictionaries, most similar first, each shaped like:

        The function is `async` because it waits on the database. While it
        waits, the server is free to handle other users' requests rather than
        sitting idle.
