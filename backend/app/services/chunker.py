==========
WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
It cuts a long document into small, self-contained pieces called CHUNKS.

    a 40-page handbook  ->  ~120 chunks of roughly 400 tokens each

WHY NOT JUST EMBED THE WHOLE DOCUMENT?
--------------------------------------
Two reasons, and the second is the more important one.

  1. SIZE. A language model can only read so much text at once. A 300-page
     manual will not fit into a prompt, full stop.

  2. PRECISION. This is the real reason. An embedding is a single point in
     "meaning space". If you embed an entire book, you get one point meaning
     "a book about many things" -- which sits close to nothing in particular
     and matches every query equally weakly.

     Embed one paragraph and you get a point representing ONE clear idea. It
     matches sharply when it is relevant and not at all when it is not.

     Chunking is also what lets an answer say "page 12" instead of "somewhere
     in this 300-page file".

WHAT MAKES THIS "TOKEN-AWARE"
-----------------------------
Models do not read characters or words. They read TOKENS -- pieces of words
produced by the model's own tokenizer. "unbelievable" might be three tokens;
a Chinese character might be two; a space is often part of the next token.

So chunking by character count is guesswork: 2,000 characters might be 400
tokens of English or 1,200 tokens of code, and the second one silently
overflows the model's window.

We use `tiktoken` with the `cl100k_base` encoding to convert text into the
actual token IDs, slice THOSE, then decode back to text. The result is chunks
that are genuinely the requested size.

WHAT MAKES THIS "PAGE-AWARE"
----------------------------
Before doing anything else, the text is split on the page markers that
extractor.py inserted. Each page is then chunked INDEPENDENTLY.

That matters for two reasons: no chunk ever straddles a page boundary and
becomes impossible to cite, and every chunk carries the page number it came
from -- which is exactly what the citation cards in the UI display.
