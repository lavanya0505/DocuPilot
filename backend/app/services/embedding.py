============
WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
It turns TEXT into NUMBERS. That is the whole job.

    "annual leave policy"  ->  [0.021, -0.184, 0.377, ... 384 numbers total]

That list of numbers is called an EMBEDDING (or a "vector").

WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT THAT?
---------------------------
Because computers cannot compare meanings, but they CAN compare numbers.

The model that produces these numbers was trained so that text with a similar
MEANING lands in a similar place. Picture every possible sentence as a dot in
space: "how many holidays do I get" and "annual leave entitlement" end up as
two dots sitting right next to each other, even though they share zero words.
"chocolate cake recipe" lands far away from both.

So to find the passage that answers a question, we:
   1. convert the question into a vector,
   2. convert every paragraph of every document into a vector (done once, at
      upload time),
   3. find whichever paragraph vectors sit closest to the question vector.

That is semantic search, and it is step "R" (Retrieval) of RAG.

WHERE THIS FITS IN THE PIPELINE
-------------------------------
Called from TWO places, and this is the key thing to understand:

  * app/tasks/ingestion.py -- when a document is uploaded. Every chunk gets
    embedded and the vectors are saved into Postgres. Happens ONCE per chunk.

  * app/services/retrieval.py -- when a user asks a question. The QUESTION is
    embedded and compared against the saved chunk vectors. Happens on every
    search.

Both sides MUST use the same model. Vectors from two different models are not
comparable at all -- it would be like measuring one in centimetres and the
other in pounds. That is why the model name is stored alongside every vector.

THE PROVIDER PATTERN
--------------------
Rather than hard-wiring one embedding company into the codebase, this file
exposes ONE function, `get_embeddings()`, and internally routes to whichever
provider `settings.EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` names. Swapping OpenAI for a local model
is then a one-line change in .env, and no other file in the project notices.
