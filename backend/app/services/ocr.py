======
WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition. In plain terms:

    "Here is a PICTURE of some text. Tell me what the letters say."

This is what makes scanned documents searchable. A scanned contract is not a
document as far as a computer is concerned -- it is a photograph. There is no
text inside it to extract, only coloured pixels. OCR looks at those pixels and
works out which letters they form.

WHEN THIS RUNS
--------------
Two situations, both triggered from extractor.py:

  1. An image file was uploaded (.png, .jpg, ...). There is nothing but pixels,
     so OCR is the only option.

  2. A PDF turned out to be a scan. extractor.py measures the text it got back
     and, if a PDF averages fewer than 100 characters per page, concludes there
     is no text layer and calls `ocr_pdf` instead.

HOW A PDF PAGE BECOMES AN IMAGE
-------------------------------
OCR engines read images, not PDFs. So each page is RASTERISED first -- drawn
into a bitmap, exactly as it would look on screen -- and that bitmap is handed
to the OCR engine.

The resolution matters. Too low and the letters blur into each other and OCR
guesses wrong; too high and it is slow and memory-hungry for no extra accuracy.
150 DPI is the usual sweet spot for printed text.

THE PROVIDER PATTERN, AND WHY THERE IS A MOCK
---------------------------------------------
Three real engines are supported (Tesseract, EasyOCR, PaddleOCR), chosen by the
`OCR_PROVIDER` setting, plus a mock.

Every one of them falls back to the mock rather than raising. That is
deliberate: Tesseract is a SEPARATE PROGRAM that must be installed on the
operating system -- it is not a Python package, so `pip install` does not
provide it. Without the fallback, anyone cloning this repository without
Tesseract would see their uploads fail with a confusing crash. Instead the
pipeline completes, the document is still chunked and embedded, and the log
says plainly what is missing.
