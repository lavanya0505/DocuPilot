WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
Endpoints for inspecting the background job system.

    POST /tasks/trigger-add         run a trivial test job
    POST /tasks/trigger-document    run a simulated ingestion job
    GET  /tasks/status/{task_id}    check what happened to a job

WHY THESE EXIST
---------------
They are DIAGNOSTIC endpoints, not product features.

The most common thing to go wrong when setting this project up is that
documents sit on "Queued" forever. That happens when the Celery worker is not
running, or cannot reach Redis -- and from the outside it looks identical to
the app simply being broken.

`/tasks/trigger-add` isolates the question. It queues a job that adds two
numbers. If the status becomes SUCCESS, the whole broker/worker chain is
healthy and the problem lies in the ingestion pipeline itself. If it stays
PENDING forever, no worker is listening. That one test cuts the search space in
half immediately.

WHAT THE STATUS VALUES MEAN
---------------------------
    PENDING  queued, or -- confusingly -- unknown. Celery cannot tell the
             difference between "waiting" and "no such task", because both
             simply mean "no result recorded".
    STARTED  a worker has picked it up. Only reported because we enabled
             `task_track_started` in core/celery_app.py.
    SUCCESS  finished; `result` holds the return value.
    FAILURE  raised an exception; `result` holds the error.
    RETRY    failed and is being attempted again.
