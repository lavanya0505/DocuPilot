WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
Endpoints for managing projects -- the document collections that also act as
search boundaries.

    GET  /projects/   list the projects in MY organization
    POST /projects/   create one  (Admin or Manager only)

THE TENANT ISOLATION PATTERN, IN ITS SIMPLEST FORM
--------------------------------------------------
This file is the clearest illustration of how isolation works throughout the
application. Look at the list query:

        .where(Project.org_id == current_user.org_id)

`current_user` comes from the verified JWT, so `org_id` is a value the server
established at login. It is never read from the request. A client cannot ask
for another organization's projects, because there is no parameter through
which to ask -- the filter is not optional and not client-controlled.

Every read path in this codebase follows that same shape, right down to the
vector search in services/retrieval.py.
