=========
WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
Exposes semantic search over the web, as `POST /api/v1/search`.

This is retrieval WITHOUT the AI answer. You send a question, you get back the
document passages that most closely match its meaning, ranked by how close.

WHY HAVE THIS SEPARATELY FROM CHAT?
-----------------------------------
Two solid reasons:

  1. Sometimes you just want to FIND the passage, not read a summary of it.
     It is faster (no LLM call at all) and cheaper.

  2. It is the single best debugging tool in the project. If a chat answer
     looks wrong, the cause is either bad retrieval or bad generation. Calling
     this endpoint with the same question shows you exactly what the AI was
     given, which tells you immediately which half is at fault.

HOW A FASTAPI ENDPOINT IS PUT TOGETHER
--------------------------------------
    @router.post("/")            <- HTTP method and URL path
    async def semantic_search(   <- `async` so the server can serve others
                                    while this one waits on the database
        payload: SearchRequest,  <- FastAPI parses+validates the JSON body
        db = Depends(get_db),    <- "dependency injection": FastAPI supplies
        user = Depends(...),        a database session and the logged-in user
    )

`Depends(...)` is the important idea. Rather than every endpoint opening its
own database connection and decoding the auth token itself, it declares WHAT it
needs and FastAPI provides it. The authentication dependency also rejects the
request outright if the token is missing or invalid, so by the time the body of
the function runs, `current_user` is guaranteed to be a real, active user.
