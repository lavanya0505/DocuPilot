============
WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
Endpoints for getting files into the system and back out again.

    POST /documents/upload              upload one or more files
    GET  /documents/?project_id=...     list a project's documents + status
    GET  /documents/{id}/preview        download the original file

THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THE UPLOAD ENDPOINT
--------------------------------------------------
It returns `202 Accepted`, not `201 Created`, and that status code is telling
the truth about what happened.

Processing a document takes seconds to minutes -- extraction, possibly OCR,
chunking, embedding. If that ran here, the browser would sit waiting and
eventually time out on a large scan.

So this endpoint does only the fast part:

    1. validate the project and the caller's access to it
    2. hash the bytes and check for a duplicate
    3. work out the version number
    4. write the file to disk
    5. create a Document row with status "pending"
    6. drop a job id onto the Redis queue
    7. reply immediately

A Celery worker then does the real work (see tasks/ingestion.py), and the
frontend polls the list endpoint until `status` reads "completed".

202 means exactly that: "I have accepted this, but it is not finished yet."

TWO FEATURES WORTH UNDERSTANDING
--------------------------------
DEDUPLICATION -- every file is SHA-256 hashed. Because the hash is of the
CONTENT, a renamed copy is still recognised, so the expensive OCR and embedding
work is never repeated for a file the project already has.

VERSIONING -- uploading a file whose NAME already exists stores it as version
2, 3 and so on rather than overwriting. Nothing is silently lost.
