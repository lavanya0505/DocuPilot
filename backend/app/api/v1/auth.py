WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
Handles everything to do with proving who you are:

    POST /auth/signup    create an account (and usually an organization)
    POST /auth/login     exchange email + password for tokens
    POST /auth/refresh   exchange a refresh token for a new pair

HOW SIGNUP CREATES A TENANT
---------------------------
Signup does double duty, decided by which field you send:

    org_name supplied  ->  create a NEW organization, and make this user its
                           Admin. This is how a company onboards.

    org_id supplied    ->  join an EXISTING organization with the requested
                           role. This is how a colleague is added.

That is why the first user of any organization is always an Admin: somebody has
to be able to administer it, and at that moment they are the only person there.

WHY LOGIN LOOKS DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER ENDPOINT
---------------------------------------------------
It takes `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm` rather than a JSON body, so the request is
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and the email arrives under the field name
`username`.

That is not an oversight -- it is the OAuth2 password-flow standard. Following
it means the interactive docs at /docs get a working "Authorize" button, and
any standard OAuth2 client library can talk to this API unmodified.
