WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
This is where the whole RAG pipeline finally comes together. Everything else in
the project -- extraction, OCR, chunking, embedding, retrieval, the LLM client
-- exists so that this file can answer a question about your documents.

THE FULL JOURNEY OF ONE QUESTION
--------------------------------
When a user types "How many leave days do I get?" and presses enter:

   1. The request arrives here with a JWT proving who they are.
   2. We verify the chat session belongs to them          (security)
   3. We save their question as a ChatMessage             (role="user")
   4. RETRIEVE : retrieval.py embeds the question and finds the 5 closest
                 chunks in Postgres, restricted to their organization.
   5. AUGMENT  : llm.py pastes those 5 chunks into a prompt, numbered [1]..[5].
   6. GENERATE : Groq's Llama 3.3 writes an answer using only those excerpts.
   7. We build citations linking each [n] back to its file and page.
   8. We save the answer as a ChatMessage                 (role="assistant")
      along with the citations, token count and how long it took.
   9. We return both messages so the UI can render the exchange.

ENDPOINTS DEFINED HERE
----------------------
    POST   /chat/sessions                     start a conversation
    GET    /chat/sessions                     list my conversations
    GET    /chat/sessions/{id}/messages       read one conversation
    POST   /chat/sessions/{id}/messages       ask a question  <- the main one
    DELETE /chat/sessions/{id}                delete a conversation
    POST   /chat/messages/{id}/feedback       rate an answer
