deps.py  (dependencies)
=======================
WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
Provides the reusable pieces that endpoints declare they NEED, rather than
build for themselves:

    get_db                 an open database session
    get_current_user       the logged-in user, decoded from the JWT
    get_current_active_user  ...and confirmed not to be deactivated
    RoleChecker            ...and confirmed to hold a specific role

WHAT "DEPENDENCY INJECTION" MEANS IN FASTAPI
--------------------------------------------
An endpoint states its requirements in its signature:

    async def list_projects(
        db: AsyncSession = Depends(deps.get_db),
        current_user: User = Depends(deps.get_current_active_user),
    ):

FastAPI reads that, runs each dependency first, and passes the results in. The
endpoint body never opens a connection or parses a token.

WHY THIS IS A SECURITY FEATURE, NOT JUST TIDINESS
--------------------------------------------------
If the token is missing, malformed, expired, or belongs to a deactivated
account, the dependency raises `HTTPException` and the endpoint body NEVER
RUNS. Authentication cannot be forgotten, because it is not something the
endpoint has to remember to do -- it is a precondition of being called at all.

By the time your code executes, `current_user` is guaranteed to be a real,
active user. There is no unauthenticated code path.

# which endpoint to call when you click "Authorize", so you can try protected
# endpoints straight from the browser.
