WHAT THIS FILE IS
-----------------
The front door of the entire backend. This is the file the web server runs:

    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
                ^^^^^^^^ ^^^
                module   the `app` object created below

Everything a browser or the frontend sends arrives here first, and this file
decides which piece of code handles it.

WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES, IN ORDER
-------------------------------
  1. Creates the FastAPI application object.
  2. Adds CORS middleware, so the Next.js frontend is allowed to call us.
  3. Registers every group of endpoints ("routers") under a URL prefix.
  4. Defines a couple of small status endpoints of its own.

WHAT IS A ROUTER?
-----------------
Rather than writing all fifty endpoints in one enormous file, related endpoints
are grouped into their own module -- everything about documents in
`api/v1/documents.py`, everything about chat in `api/v1/chat.py`, and so on.
Each module exposes a `router`, and this file mounts them all onto the app with
a URL prefix. That is why `chat.py` can define its path as just `/sessions`
while the real, public URL ends up being `/api/v1/chat/sessions`.

THE REQUEST LIFECYCLE
---------------------
    Browser
      -> CORS middleware        (is this website allowed to call us?)
      -> router matching        (which function handles this URL?)
      -> dependencies           (open a DB session, decode the JWT, load user)
      -> your endpoint function (the actual work)
      -> Pydantic response model(filter and serialise the output)
      -> Browser

# CORS -- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES:
# Browsers enforce the "same-origin policy". A page loaded from
# http://localhost:3000 is NOT allowed to make requests to
# http://localhost:8000, because a different port counts as a different origin.
# Without the middleware below, every frontend request would fail with an
# opaque CORS error in the console -- and this is the single most common thing
# to trip up people wiring a React frontend to a Python API for the first time.
#
# `allow_origins` is the explicit list of sites we trust. In development that is
# localhost:3000; in production the deployed frontend URL is appended via the
# FRONTEND_ORIGIN environment variable. See `cors_origins` in core/config.py.
#
# Note this is a browser-enforced rule, not a server firewall: tools such as
# curl and Postman ignore CORS entirely. Real access control is done by the JWT
# authentication on each endpoint, not here.
