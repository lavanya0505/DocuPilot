"""Add RAG support: fixed vector dimension, HNSW index, per-project duplicates

WHAT IS A MIGRATION?
--------------------
The Python classes in app/models/ describe what the database SHOULD look like.
A migration is the set of instructions that CHANGES a real, existing database
from its current shape to that new shape -- without destroying the data already
inside it.

Alembic keeps a small table called `alembic_version` in your database recording
which migration was applied last. Running `alembic upgrade head` applies every
migration newer than that. This is how the same schema change gets applied
identically on your laptop, on a teammate's machine, and on the production
server, in the right order, exactly once each.

WHAT THIS PARTICULAR MIGRATION FIXES
------------------------------------
Three real problems that blocked semantic search from working:

  1. The `embedding` column was declared as `vector` with NO dimension.
     Postgres accepted vectors of any size, which meant a 384-number vector and
     a 1536-number vector could sit in the same column -- and comparing them is
     meaningless. Worse, pgvector REFUSES to build an index on a dimensionless
     column, so every search had to read every row.

  2. There was no vector index at all. We add an HNSW index, which turns search
     from "compare against every row" into "hop through a graph towards the
     nearest neighbours".

  3. `documents.duplicate_hash` was globally UNIQUE. That is a genuine
     multi-tenancy bug: if Company A uploaded a file, Company B uploading the
     very same file would hit a unique-constraint violation and be blocked --
     and could even infer that some other tenant had that exact file. We
     replace it with a UNIQUE constraint scoped to (project_id, duplicate_hash),
     which is what the upload code in api/v1/documents.py already assumes.

    # This teaches Postgres the `vector` data type and the distance operators.

    # meaningful way to turn 1536 numbers into 384 -- so the rows must go.

    # chunks and completely unusable at scale.

    #                        Higher gives a better index but a slower build.
