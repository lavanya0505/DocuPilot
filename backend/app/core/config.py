=========
WHAT THIS FILE IS
-----------------
This is the single place where every "setting" of the whole backend lives.

Think of it as the control panel of the application. Database address, secret
keys, which AI model to use, how many chunks to retrieve -- all of it is here.

HOW IT WORKS (the important idea)
---------------------------------
We use `pydantic-settings`. It does one clever thing for us:

    every attribute you see below can be overridden by an environment variable
    of the SAME NAME, or by a line in the `.env` file.

Example: below we write `POSTGRES_PORT: int = 5433`.
  - If nothing else is provided, the value is 5433.
  - If `.env` contains `POSTGRES_PORT=5432`, the value becomes 5432.
  - If the server has an env var `POSTGRES_PORT=6000`, that wins.

This is why the same code can run on your laptop and on Render without editing
a single line -- only the environment changes.

The `int` / `bool` / `Literal` annotations also VALIDATE the value. If someone
sets `PORT=hello`, the app refuses to start with a clear error message instead
of crashing mysteriously somewhere else later.

WHO USES THIS FILE
------------------
Almost everyone. `from app.core.config import settings` appears in the database
layer, the Celery worker, the security layer, the AI services and the API
routes. There is exactly ONE `settings` object (created on the last line of
this file) and every other module shares it.
