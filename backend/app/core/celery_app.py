=============
WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
Configures Celery -- the system that runs slow work OUTSIDE the web request.

THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES
---------------------
Processing a 200-page scanned PDF takes minutes: rasterise every page, OCR it,
chunk it, embed it. If that ran inside the upload request, the user's browser
would sit on a spinner and eventually time out.

So instead:

    1. The upload endpoint saves the file and writes a Document row with
       status "pending".
    2. It calls `process_document_task.delay(document_id)`, which does NOT run
       the function -- it drops a small message onto Redis and returns instantly.
    3. The API responds to the browser in milliseconds.
    4. A separate WORKER process, possibly on another machine entirely, picks
       that message up and does the real work.
    5. The frontend polls the document's status until it reads "completed".

THE THREE PIECES
----------------
    BROKER   Redis. The queue that holds pending jobs.
    WORKER   A separate process you start yourself:
                 celery -A app.core.celery_app.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
             (add --pool=solo on Windows -- Windows has no fork())
    BACKEND  Where results and statuses are stored. Also Redis here.

Broker and backend are different roles: the broker carries work TO the worker,
the backend carries answers BACK. They happen to use the same Redis server,
which is normal for a project this size.

celery_app = Celery(
    # A label for this app, shown in logs and monitoring tools.
    "document_intelligence_tasks",
    # Where jobs are QUEUED.

# CONFIGURATION
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
celery_app.conf.update(
    # Report a task as STARTED the moment a worker picks it up. Without this,
    # a task sits in PENDING right up until it finishes, so the UI cannot tell
    # "queued behind other work" apart from "actively being processed".

    # ---- Serialisation ----
    # JSON rather than Python's `pickle`. This is a security decision, not a
    # preference: pickle can execute arbitrary code when it deserialises, so
    # anyone able to write to the queue could run code on your worker. JSON
    # can only ever describe data.
    task_serializer="json",
    result_serializer="json",
    accept_content=["json"],

    # ---- Time ----
    # Always work in UTC internally. Servers, developers and users sit in
    # different time zones; storing anything else guarantees confusion, and
    # breaks twice a year when clocks change.
    timezone="UTC",
    enable_utc=True,

    # ---- Housekeeping ----
    # Discard stored results after 1 day (86400 seconds). Without an expiry,
    # every task result accumulates in Redis forever and slowly consumes all
    # its memory.
    result_expires=86400,

    # Explicitly import the tasks package on worker start-up. A task the worker
    # has never imported is not registered, and any job for it fails with
    # "Received unregistered task" -- a genuinely confusing error, because the
    # code plainly exists.
    imports=("app.tasks",),
)

# A second safety net: scan the `app` package for anything decorated with
# `@celery_app.task`. Between this and `imports` above, a newly added task is
# picked up without further configuration.
