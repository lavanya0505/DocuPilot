WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
Two separate security jobs live here:

    1. PASSWORD HASHING  -- storing passwords so a database leak is survivable.
    2. TOKEN CREATION    -- issuing the JWTs that prove who a user is.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART 1: WHY PASSWORDS ARE HASHED, NOT ENCRYPTED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
We never store the password itself. We store a HASH -- a one-way fingerprint:

    "hunter2"  ->  "$2b$12$KIXQJ8f0Zx9Yq2rL8mNc.uO7hT3vB1sD4gF6hJ9kL2mN5pQ8rS1tU"

One-way means the hash cannot be turned back into the password. To check a
login we hash what the user typed and compare the two fingerprints.

So if the database is stolen, the attacker gets fingerprints, not passwords.

WHY BCRYPT SPECIFICALLY?
Because it is DELIBERATELY SLOW. A fast hash like SHA-256 can be computed
billions of times per second on a GPU, so an attacker simply tries every common
password. Bcrypt takes ~100ms per attempt by design, turning a few hours of
brute forcing into several years.

Bcrypt also salts automatically: a random value is mixed into every hash, so
two users with the same password get completely different fingerprints. That
defeats "rainbow tables" -- precomputed lists of hash-to-password mappings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART 2: WHAT A JWT IS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A JSON Web Token is a signed string with three dot-separated parts:

    eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9 . eyJzdWIiOiIxMjMiLCJyb2xlIjoi... . dBjftJeZ4CVP...
    └─ header ─────────┘   └─ payload (the claims) ─────┘   └─ signature ─┘

The payload is only base64-encoded, NOT encrypted -- anyone can read it. What
the signature guarantees is that nobody has CHANGED it, because producing a
valid signature requires SECRET_KEY.

    => Never put anything confidential in a token.
    => Do put identity and role in it, so the API can authorise a request
       without a database lookup on every call.

WHY TWO KINDS OF TOKEN?
    ACCESS token   short-lived (30 min). Sent with every request. If it is
                   stolen, the damage window is small.
    REFRESH token  long-lived (7 days). Used ONLY to obtain a new access token.
                   Sent rarely, so it is far less exposed.

That pairing is what lets us have both short-lived credentials and a user who
is not forced to log in twice an hour.
