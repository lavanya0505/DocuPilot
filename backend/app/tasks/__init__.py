=================
WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
Imports every Celery task, so the worker knows they exist.

WHY THIS IS REQUIRED, NOT OPTIONAL
----------------------------------
A Celery worker can only run a task it has REGISTERED, and a task registers
itself when the module defining it is imported. Python never scans folders
looking for functions -- code that is not imported does not exist.

If a task is missing from this list, queueing it appears to work (the message
lands on Redis perfectly happily) and then the worker rejects it with:

        Received unregistered task of type 'app.tasks.ingestion...'

which is a genuinely misleading error, because the function is plainly sitting
right there in the source.

This file is imported by the worker because `core/celery_app.py` sets
`imports=("app.tasks",)`.
