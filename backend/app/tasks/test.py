"""
test.py  (diagnostic Celery tasks)
==================================
WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
Two fake background jobs used to verify that the queue system works.

Neither does anything real: no files are read, no database is touched, no AI is
called. They exist purely to answer one question:

        "Is the worker actually running and picking up jobs?"

WHY THAT QUESTION IS WORTH A DEDICATED TOOL
-------------------------------------------
The single most common setup problem with this project is documents sitting on
"Queued" forever. There are several possible causes -- the worker was never
started, Redis is not running, the worker cannot reach Redis, the task was
never registered -- and from the outside they all look identical.

Running `POST /tasks/trigger-add` separates them instantly:

    SUCCESS       the broker, the worker and the result backend are all fine,
                  so the fault is inside the ingestion pipeline itself.
    PENDING       nothing is consuming the queue: no worker, or no Redis.

That halves the search space in one request. The real pipeline lives in
`tasks/ingestion.py`; nothing here is used in normal operation.

    The `name=` argument pins the task's identity. Without it Celery derives a
    name from the module path, so moving or renaming this file would strand any
    jobs already sitting in the queue under the old name.

    The deliberate 2-second pause makes the asynchronous behaviour visible: the
    HTTP response returns immediately, and you can watch the status move from
    PENDING through STARTED to SUCCESS by polling /tasks/status/{id}.

    runs to completion and that its log output is visible in the worker
    terminal.
