============
WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
This is the document processing pipeline -- everything that happens to a file
AFTER it is uploaded and BEFORE it can be searched.

WHY IT RUNS IN THE BACKGROUND
-----------------------------
Processing a document is slow. A 200-page scanned PDF can take minutes: every
page must be rasterised, OCR'd, chunked and embedded.

If we did that inside the upload request, the user's browser would sit on a
loading spinner for two minutes and then very likely time out.

So instead:

    1. The upload endpoint saves the file, creates a Document row with
       status="pending", and IMMEDIATELY replies to the browser.
    2. It drops a job id onto a Redis queue.
    3. A separate Celery worker process picks that job up and runs THIS file.
    4. The frontend polls the document's status until it reads "completed".

The user gets an instant response, and the heavy work happens out of sight.
This is the standard "task queue" pattern, and it is what the `status` column
on Document exists to support.

THE SEVEN STAGES OF THE PIPELINE
--------------------------------
      file on disk
          |
      1.  validate           does the file still exist?
          |
      2.  EXTRACT            extractor.py -> raw text  (+ OCR if it is a scan)
          |
      3.  CHUNK              chunker.py   -> ~500-token pieces, page-tagged
          |
      4.  save chunks        the readable text goes into the `chunks` table
          |
      5.  EMBED              embedding.py -> a 384-number vector per chunk
          |
      6.  save vectors       into `chunk_embeddings`, ready for search
          |
      7.  record metadata    language, word count, timings, settings used
          |
      status = "completed"   the document is now searchable

HOW THE ASYNC/SYNC BRIDGE WORKS
-------------------------------
Celery is a SYNCHRONOUS system -- its tasks are ordinary blocking functions.
Our database layer is ASYNCHRONOUS. The two cannot call each other directly.

The solution is at the bottom of this file: the Celery task is a small ordinary
function that calls `asyncio.run(...)`, which spins up an event loop, runs our
async code to completion inside it, then shuts it down. This is also exactly
why db/session.py configures `NullPool` -- connections must not be reused
across these short-lived event loops, or you get "Event loop is closed" errors.
