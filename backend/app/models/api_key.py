WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
Defines the API_KEYS table -- long-lived credentials for PROGRAMS rather than
people.

WHY BOTH JWTs AND API KEYS?
---------------------------
They serve different callers:

    JWT       for a human in a browser. Short-lived (30 min), obtained by
              typing a password, refreshed silently in the background.

    API key   for a script, a cron job or another service. There is nobody to
              type a password, so the credential must be long-lived and stored
              in the caller's configuration.

THE KEY IS HASHED, EXACTLY LIKE A PASSWORD
------------------------------------------
This is the important design point. When a key is generated it is shown to the
user ONCE and never stored in readable form. What the database keeps is:

    key_prefix   "sk_live_a3f9"   the first few characters, for display only
    hashed_key   SHA-256 of the whole key

To authenticate a request we hash the presented key and look for a matching
`hashed_key`. So a leaked database yields no usable credentials -- exactly the
same reasoning as `hashed_password` on the User model.

The prefix exists purely so a dashboard can say "sk_live_a3f9..." and let
someone identify which of their keys is which, without ever revealing one.

    # The automatic naming rule in db/base_class.py inserts an underscore before
    # every internal capital letter. "APIKey" is three capitals in a row, so it
    # would become the unreadable table name "a_p_i_keys". This is exactly the

    # SHA-256 of the full key. Exactly 64 hex characters, hence String(64).
    #
    # `unique=True` prevents the same key existing twice; `index=True` because
    # every authenticated request looks a key up by this column, and a scan of
    # the whole table on each request would be unacceptable.
    #
    # NOTE: SHA-256 is used here rather than bcrypt, and that is correct.
    # Bcrypt is deliberately slow to defend SHORT, guessable human passwords.
    # An API key is long and randomly generated, so it cannot be brute-forced,
    # and a slow hash would just add latency to every single request.
