WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
Defines the AUDIT_LOGS table -- a permanent record of who did what, and when.

WHY AN AUDIT LOG MATTERS HERE
-----------------------------
This application holds a company's internal documents. Sooner or later somebody
needs to answer questions like:

    "Who uploaded this contract, and when?"
    "Which documents did this person access before they left?"
    "Who deleted the Q3 policy?"

Application logs are not good enough for that: they rotate, they are unstructured
and they are usually thrown away after a week. An audit trail is structured,
queryable and kept.

THE ONE UNUSUAL DESIGN DECISION
-------------------------------
`user_id` uses `ON DELETE SET NULL`, whereas nearly every other foreign key in
this schema uses `ON DELETE CASCADE`.

That is deliberate, and it is the whole point of an audit log. If deleting a
user also deleted their audit entries, then removing an account would erase the
evidence of everything that account ever did -- which is precisely the situation
an audit trail exists to prevent.

So the record survives. `user_id` becomes NULL, but the action, the timestamp,
the IP address and the details remain.
