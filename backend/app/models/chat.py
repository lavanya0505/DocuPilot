=======
WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
Defines the three tables that store conversations:

    ChatSession   one conversation thread
    ChatMessage   one message in it, from the user or the assistant
    Feedback      a thumbs up or down on an assistant answer

WHY CONVERSATIONS ARE STORED AT ALL
-----------------------------------
Three reasons, and the second is the one that changes how the app behaves:

  1. HISTORY. Users can reopen an old conversation and reread the answers.

  2. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS. This is the important one. Before generating an
     answer, `RetrievalService.build_history` loads the last few messages and
     includes them in the prompt. That is what lets someone ask "and what about
     part-time staff?" and be understood. Without stored messages, every
     question would be treated as the first.

  3. EVALUATION. Storing latency, token usage and the citations actually used
     is what makes it possible to measure whether the system is working.

THE CITATIONS COLUMN IS THE INTERESTING ONE
-------------------------------------------
Each assistant message stores the exact excerpts its answer was built from --
file, page, similarity score and a snippet. That is what makes the answer
verifiable rather than something you simply have to trust, and it is why the UI
can show expandable source cards under every reply.
