models/__init__.py
==================
WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
Imports every database model in one place.

WHY THAT IS NECESSARY, NOT JUST TIDY
------------------------------------
A SQLAlchemy model only registers itself with `Base.metadata` when its module
is actually IMPORTED. Python does not scan folders looking for classes -- code
that is never imported simply does not exist as far as the program is concerned.

Two things depend on that registry being complete:

  1. ALEMBIC MIGRATIONS. `alembic revision --autogenerate` compares
     `Base.metadata` against the real database to work out what changed. A
     model that was never imported is invisible to it, so Alembic would
     conclude its table should be DROPPED -- or would never create it at all.

  2. RELATIONSHIP RESOLUTION. Relationships refer to other models by NAME, as
     strings: `relationship("Document", ...)`. SQLAlchemy resolves those names
     later, once everything is loaded. If `Document` was never imported, that
     lookup fails at runtime with "expression 'Document' failed to locate a
     name".

So this file is what makes the whole model layer coherent. Importing
`app.models` anywhere pulls in every table at once.

THE ORDER MATTERS
-----------------
Models are listed roughly parent-first (Organization, then User, then Project,
then Document...). Not strictly required -- string-based relationships are
resolved lazily -- but it mirrors the real ownership hierarchy and makes the
schema readable at a glance.
