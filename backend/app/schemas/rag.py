=================
WHAT A "SCHEMA" IS AND WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
-------------------------------------------
A schema is a description of the SHAPE of data going into or coming out of the
API. We write them with Pydantic, and FastAPI uses them to do four jobs for
free -- jobs you would otherwise have to hand-write in every endpoint:

  1. VALIDATE incoming JSON. If the browser sends `top_k: "banana"` where a
     number is required, FastAPI rejects it with a clear 422 error before a
     single line of our code runs.
  2. CONVERT types. A UUID arrives as a string in JSON; Pydantic turns it into
     a real `uuid.UUID` object automatically.
  3. FILTER outgoing data. Only fields declared here are sent to the client.
     This is a genuine security feature -- it is why a User response can never
     accidentally leak `hashed_password`, even if the object holds it.
  4. DOCUMENT the API. The interactive docs at /docs are generated from these
     classes, so the documentation can never drift out of date with the code.

NAMING CONVENTION USED THROUGHOUT THIS PROJECT
----------------------------------------------
    ...Request / ...Create  -> data coming IN from the client
    ...Out / ...Response    -> data going OUT to the client

Keeping those separate matters: the fields a client is allowed to SEND are
rarely the same as the fields we are willing to RETURN.
