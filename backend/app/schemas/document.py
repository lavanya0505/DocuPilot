"""
document.py  (schemas)
======================
WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
Describes what the API returns about an uploaded document.

WHY THERE IS NO "DocumentCreate" SCHEMA
---------------------------------------
Every other resource has one, but documents are created by a FILE UPLOAD, and
a file upload is not JSON.

Browsers send files as `multipart/form-data`, so the upload endpoint declares
its inputs individually with `File(...)` and `Form(...)` instead:

    files: List[UploadFile] = File(...)
    project_id: uuid.UUID = Form(...)
    chunk_strategy: str = Form("fixed_size")

Everything else about the document -- its size, its type, its checksum -- is
derived by the server from the file itself, never accepted from the client.

WHY `status` AND `meta_data` ARE THE INTERESTING FIELDS
-------------------------------------------------------
Because processing happens in a background worker, these two fields are how the
browser learns what happened to a file after it was accepted. The frontend
polls this shape until `status` reads "completed".
