===================
WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
Describes the shape of authentication tokens -- both what we hand back after a
successful login, and what we expect to find inside a token when decoding one.

REMINDER OF HOW THE TWO TOKENS WORK
-----------------------------------
    ACCESS token   30 minutes. Sent with every API request. Short-lived so a
                   stolen one is only briefly useful.
    REFRESH token  7 days. Used ONLY to obtain a new access token, so it
                   travels rarely and is far less exposed.

Together they give short-lived credentials without forcing the user to log in
again twice an hour. See core/security.py for how they are created.

    The claims we expect to find INSIDE a decoded token.

    Used in api/deps.py: after `jwt.decode` verifies the signature, the raw
    dictionary is parsed through this model so the rest of the code works with
    typed fields instead of unchecked dictionary lookups.

    EVERY FIELD IS OPTIONAL, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.
    A forged or malformed token might be missing any of them. If they were
    required, Pydantic would raise a validation error that could escape as an
    unhandled 500. Optional fields mean the code can check them explicitly and
    return a clean 401 instead -- an attacker learns nothing from a crash.
